# CTBot

Branch: master - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shurillu/CTBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shurillu/CTBot)


___
### Introduction
CTBot is a simple Arduino class to manage Telegram Bot on ESP8266/ESP32 platform.
It relies on [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) library so, in order to use a CTBot object, you need to install the ArduinoJson library first (you can use library manager).
You also need to install the [ESP8266 Arduino Core and Library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or the [ESP32 Arduino Core and Library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).
Don't you know Telegram bots and how to setup one? Check [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

+ **_ESP8266 don't use anymore the fingerprint for Telegram certificate validation_** 
+ **_Now ArduinoJson version 5, 6 and 7 are supported!_**
+ **_getNewMessage method now is more responsive!!_**

### News
+ Arduino JSON v7.* support
+ ESP32 supported
+ ArduinoJson version 5 and 6 supported

### Feature
+ ESP8266/ESP32 supported
+ Manage WiFi connection (methods for connecting to an access point, set a static IP)
+ Send and receive messages
+ Inline keyboards
+ Receive localization messages
+ Reply keyboards
+ Receive contacts messages

### Supported boards
The library works with the ESP8266/ESP32 chipset: all the ESP8266/ESP32 boards are supported.

### Simple usage
See the EchoBot example provided in the [examples folder](https://github.com/shurillu/CTBot/tree/master/examples).
