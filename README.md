# CTBot

Branch: dev - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shurillu/CTBot.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/shurillu/CTBot)


___
### Introduction
CTBot is a simple Arduino class to manage Telegram Bot on ESP8266/ESP32 platform.
It relies on [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) library so, in order to use a CTBot object, you need to install the ArduinoJson library first (you can use library manager).
You also need to install the [ESP8266 Arduino Core and Library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or the [ESP32 Arduino Core and Library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).
Don't you know Telegram bots and how to setup one? Check [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

+ **_Now ArduinoJson version 5 and 6 are supported!_**
